The views that are complex are the ones that are autogenerated. The views that are autogenerated
are found in `/crud_view_methods` and in `/exports`. The files that determine which models have
autogenerated views are the files named `*_methods.py*`. Each file contains a dictionary where
the keys are the class name of of a model and the value is a dictionary representing the
attributes of the class based view for that model.

Here are the conventional attributes we have defined for each class based view. Without loss
of generality we will the Actor model for the explanation. (Actor examples may not be accurate of
what we use for actor)

# Generic Model List

This class is used for list view and export view

```python
# Generic definition
class GenericModelList:
    '''
    model: The actual model class
    table_columns: A list of column names that will apeear in the list view
    column_necessary_fields: A dictionary mapping the columns name to a list of
                             model field attributes that will be used for the
                             values in the cells for that column. Dot notation
                             is supported for related key attributes
    ordering: A list of model field attributes that will be used as the default
              ordering of the list. Dot notation is supported for related key
              attributes
    field_contains: A string for the value that one if the cells in a row must
                    contain. We normally have it set to ''
    org_related_path: A query string written in django orm format representing
                      the organization field that is related to the model. This
                      is used to limit what a user is able to see based on their
                      organization is possible. (OPTIONAL)
    default_filter_kwargs: A dictionary where the keys are django orm query
                           strings and the values are the query value. This
                           dictionary is used to limit what the full queryset
                           will at most contain (OPTIONAL)
    '''
# In list_methods.py
methods = {
    'Actor': {

        'table_columns': ['Person',...],

    field_contains = '',
    #user can only see actors part of their organization
    org_related_path = 'organization'

        'description__isnull': False
    }
    paginate_by = 10

    #...methods
# Above is same for GenericModelExport
```

# Generic Model Edit

This class is used both for create and update

```python
# Generic Definition
class GenericModelEdit:
    '''
    model: The actual model class
    form_class: The actual model form class
    success_url: The url the user is redirected to after creating/updating
    '''
# In create_methods.py and in update_methods.py
methods = {
    'Actor': {
        'model': Actor,
        'form_class': forms.ActorForm,
        'success_url': reverse_lazy('actor_list')
    }
}
# what gets autogenerated
class ActorCreate:
    model: Actor
    form_class: forms.ActorForm
    success_url: reverse_lazy('actor_list')
class ActorUpdate:
    model: Actor
    form_class: forms.ActorForm
    success_url: reverse_lazy('actor_list')
```

# Generic Model View

This class is used for detail

```python
# Generic definition
class GenericModelView:
    '''
    model: The actual model class
    form_class: The actual model form class
    success_url: The url the user is redirected to after creating/updating
    '''
# In detail_methods.py
methods = {
    'model': Actor,
    'detail_fields': ['Person',...],
    'detail_fields_need_fields': {
        'Person': ['person.first_name','person.middle_name','person.last_name']
        ...
    },
}
# What gets autogenerated
class ActorView:
    model = Actor,
    detail_fields = ['Person',...],
    detail_fields_need_fields = {
        'Person': ['person.first_name','person.middle_name','person.last_name']
        ...
    },
```

Note that it is not necessary to have the all the types of views generated for a model. This
is because in `urls.py` when we conditionally check if a model has a certain view before attempting
to generate the corresponding route. For example we have Experiment's list view autogenerated,
but in `..experiment.py` we have inline custom definitions for the detail, create, edit views
for Experiment.

The list of model's that will have views autogenerated are in `utilities/utils.py` in the variable
`view_names`.

The file that acutally uses the dictionaryies in `*_methods.py` and generates the classes is
`views/crud_views.py`
